 * MasterSystem
 * The class acts as a controller class that communicates between a dataAccessor and the UI.
 * It contains the logic, necessary for taking data from the dataAccessor and transforming it
 * into what the UI needs.
 * Also, this class implements an interface that makes sure the contract is unbroken,
 * that is to say, that it follows the specifications given in the use-case diagram.
 * 
 * The two constant String variables in the beginning can be changed if necessary
 * to use different paths for the data files
